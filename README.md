## **Project Background**

As the job market grows explosively in many fields, employers and job seekers have to spend a lot of time filtering viable candidates or opportunities based on their needs, which is tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, we propose a hybrid machine learning job recommender system using content-based and collaborative filtering mechanisms to promote N-best job opportunities based on user resumes. Our curiosity drives the project about the job-seeking and recruitment logic from the employers' perspective.

## **How to run the code:**

The code can be run in Colab or local Jupyter Notebook.
